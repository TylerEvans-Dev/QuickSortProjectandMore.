# QuickSortProjectandMore.
This is an example of the quick sort algorithm made with help from the popular website Think Geek, 
However I add my own twist to the code making vectors as the values to be sorted instead of arrays.
The refrence Webpage that I used is here https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/quick-sort/
!!Much needed correction for copy right protection it is the Geeks for Geeks that I get help from!!
Thank you much,
Tyler Evans.
